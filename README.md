Purpose:
========
I personally like to know what the data, I use in applications, looks like.
Importing and altering the OSM-Data to GIS into PostgresSQL does not cut it for me, because I personaly find MySql for data exploration easier to use.
I did not find "up-to-date" tools to get the OSM-Format straight into MySql, so I wrote this command-line tool to do the job.


System requirements:
===================
+ __Plattform:__ Node.js >= v6.10.3 should run on previous versions, but is not tested

    *__dependencies:__*
    * [htmlparser2](https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2)
    * [mysqljs/sqlstring](https://github.com/mysqljs/sqlstring)

+ __Datbase:__ (optional) MySql 5.5.3 or higher. It works without a database, if you just want to save the MySql-output to disk and import it elsewhere.

+ *Recommended:* diskspace on a fast harddrive and a nice chunk of RAM for the database


Install:
========
* Install Node.js (http://nodejs.org/)
* (optionally) Install MySql locally (e.g. from http://www.apachefriends.org)
* Download and unpack the source code to a directory of your choice
* Use ```npm install``` in that directory to install the dependencies
* Create a DB named e.g. 'osm' and import the schema at [./sql/osm_structure.sql](sql/osm_structure.sql) and a MySql-client of your choice
* Get the .osm file you want to import from (http://www.openstreetmap.org) or mirrors there of


USAGE
=====
__Basic:__
```node osm_to_mysql_dump.js YourOSMXML-Document.osm```

Converts and outputs "YourOSMXML-Document.osm" to MySQL and outputs it to the screen.


__Write MySql to file:__

Assuming your OSM-XML-file resides already in the directory you installed osm_to_mysql_dump in. Simply run the command-line:

```node osm_to_mysql_dump.js [infile].osm > [outfile].sql```

You can then import the SQL-file into a MySql-Database with your mysql-native client or something like phpMyAdmin.

e.g. ```mysql -uroot -hlocalhost -pPASSWORD osm < convertedOSM.sql```


__Write MySql directly into the database via '|'-Operator and native client:__

```node osm_to_mysql_dump.js nordrhein-westfalen-latest.osm | mysql -uroot -pYOURPASSHERE -hlocalhost osm```

On a windows-system this would look something like this:

```node e:\gits\osm_to_mysql_dump\osm_to_mysql_dump.js e:\gits\nordrhein-westfalen-latest.osm | E:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql -uroot -pYOURPASSHERE -hlocalhost osm```
